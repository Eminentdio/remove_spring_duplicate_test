## Index.html


This is parent file where the input tag reside and submit `<button>`. I have script tag that links the `result.html` with `index.html` in it.

## result.html

This file contains the `.card-container` and other `<div>` that handle the input strings and the result string. There is a back `<button>` on the page to navigate back to the first page.
